__<h2 align="center">Hi, I'm Shreya! 👋 :dizzy:</h2>__

:books: I'm currently a senior at MIT studying computer science and minoring in math and German. I love creating and building new things 🛠️, exploring the world 🔭, and learning more about using tech for social good 🌱! 

:zap: This past summer, I was a software engineering intern at Braze, where I used ChatGPT to generate SQL queries for natural language user inputs and integrate them into one of Braze's user segmenting tools. 

:speech_balloon: Got a question, a potential project idea, a question, or anything about art, tech, traveling, or anything else? Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreyareshamwala) or [email](mailto:shreyar@mit.edu)!
