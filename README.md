<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Hi, I'm Shreya! 👋 :dizzy: </h1>


:books: I'm currently a senior at MIT studying computer science and minoring in math and German. I love creating and building new things 🛠️, exploring the world 🔭, and learning more about using tech for social good 🌱! 

:zap: At the moment, I'm a software engineering intern at Braze, where I'm working on integrating ChatGPT, which generates SQL queries for natural language user inputs, into one of Braze's user segmenting tools.

:speech_balloon: Got a question, a potential project idea, a question, or anything about art, tech, traveling, or anything else?
